    <!--Ok, here's where I'm going to write my pseudocode in comments-->
    
    <!--Display WebsiteNav on top-->
    <!--Display login button in top-right corner-->
    <!--Display a clickable animation of a Catan game being played one move at a time-->
    <!--Display leaderboard on right-hand side of clickable animation-->
    <!--Display images in a grid describing the way the website works-->
    <!--Display a big button that says "Try it Out" or "Begin Game"-->
    
    <!--Login-->
    <!--Display a "log-in to save stats" dismissable prompt-->
    <!--If user dismisses prompt, display a warning that reads "Warning: you will not be able to save your statistical data"-->
    <!--If user dismisses prompt again, go to the board and skip the Player Creation step-->
    <!--If user logs in, display a thank you message-->
    <!--This thank you message is the same for both the 1st login prompt and the 2nd-->
    
    <!--Player Setup and Logging Player Data-->
    <!--Display an animated grid of a blank Catan board-->
    <!--Prompt the user to select the number of players-->
    <!--Prompt user to type their names-->
    <!--Remenber names used by the user and predict the player name as the user types-->
    <!--Create a separate database for each player and log data in it-->
    <!--Logged data is available within a user's login profile-->
    <!--Users can have only one profile, but as many logged games, players, and data as possible-->
    <!--Users can call up past games through their user profile, and see moves made, resources in all player hands, and more as I develop this over time-->
    
    <!--Board Setup-->
    <!--Prompt the user to assign a color for each player-->
    <!--Prompt the user to select the position of the sheep port-->
    <!--Animate the placement of the outside water tiles-->
    <!--Prompt the user to select the first resourse tile and number marker from a list of corresponding images-->
    <!--Animate the placement of the user selected tile and number marker at the position adjacent to the sheep port-->
    <!--Repeat this process for every tile on the board, beginning at the tile adjacent to the sheep port and going clockwise in a spiral-->
    <!--After all placements are completed, prompt the user to confirm that the board looks correct-->
    <!--Allow user to make changes/edit the board by tapping specific tiles and number markers and opening the same image-based selection menu from before-->
    <!--Once user confirms board is correct, assign resource hex values and number marker values to the underlying board hex space and port spaces-->
    <!--Animate the board if possible-->

    <!--Player Settlement and Road Initial Placement-->
    <!--Prompt the user to select which player will place first-->
    <!--Display a popup menu of all available piece colors (red, blue, orange, white, green, brown)-->
    <!--Allow user to place cities and roads by tapping the board-->
    <!--Prompt user to select which player is placing second-->
    <!--Display a menu of all remaining available colors-->
    <!--Repeat fot all remaining players-->
    <!--Allow user to edit the position of pieces by tapping and dragging them-->
    <!--Limit the number of pieces and locations a user can place to follow the rules of Catan (i.e. two settlements have to be one intersection away from one another)-->
   
    <!--Initial Settlement and Road Placement-->
    <!--Once a settlement is placed, assign a value to mark the order (first, second) it was placed-->
    <!--Allow user to place roads only attached to a city-->
    <!--Once user has placed all starting pieces for all players, prompt the user to confirm final placement-->
    <!--Once user confirms, assign number marker values from number markers and resource tile values from resource tiles to corresponding settlements-->
    <!--Generate resources corresponding to the tile values of the second settlement placed for each player-->
    <!--Put those resources in each player's hand-->
    <!--Animate all this if possible-->
    <!--If that's too advanced, just represent it visually on screen-->

    <!--Selecting Dice-->
    <!--Prompt the user to select either "physical" or "virtual" dice-->
    <!--If user selects "virtual" load some virtual dice roll code-->
    <!--If user selects "physical" then don't-->
    
    <!--Virtual Dice-->
    <!--Allow the user to roll a random number and generate the corresponding resources for all players-->
    <!--Allow user to change their mind and play with physical dice instead at any time-->
    <!--Do not allow user to select specific roll numbers from a menu; only allow random number rolls-->

    <!--Physical Dice-->
    <!--Prompt user to select number from a persistent pop-up menu-->
    <!--Generate resources corresponding to number selected and put them in all appropriate player hands-->
    <!--Allow user to change to virtual dice at any time-->
    <!--Do not allow user to roll a random number while physical dice are selected-->

    <!--Gameplay-->
    <!--When a number is rolled, generate resources corresponding to the number value assigned to the number marker on each resource hex-->
    <!--If a player has a settlement or city on an intersection adjacent to that resource hex, increase the number of resources in that player's hand corresponding to the value of the resource hex by 1 or 2-->
    <!--If the robber is on that hex, do not award resources-->
    <!--Allow user to select which pieces players decide to build from a pop-up menu-->
    <!--Automatically subtract the corresponding resources from a player's hand when they are spent-->
    <!--Do not allow players to build if they do not have enough resources-->
    <!--Automatically log all this data-->
    <!--Allow players to buy and use development cards-->
    <!--Allow players to move the robber and steal resources-->
    <!--Allow players to trade resources-->
    <!--Make the trading operation as simple and easy as possible for the user-->
    
    <!--Trading Resources-->
    <!--Trading should be simple, fast, and easy-->
    <!--In order to keep up with the pace of Catan, users should be able to set up trades, and to delete them, on the fly-->
    <!--Allow user to tap a "Trade" button to bring up a menu of common trades and individual resources-->
    <!--Allow user to tap the players trading, then a number, then a resource, then an "and" button, then a "for" button, then a number, then a resource, and finally, they can confirm, edit, or dismiss the trade-->
    <!--Another way or phrasing it would be like this:-->
    <!--Player 1 initiates a trade. They are looking for wood and are willing to trade two brick for it.-->
    <!--Player 2 says they're willing to do that, then as the trade almost goes, they change their mind, and instead want a brick and a wheat-->
    <!--Player 1 says sure and they trade-->
    <!--The trading code needs to be able to accomodate all that, in a matter of seconds, the same amount of time as it takes players to verbally and physically make that trade-->

    <!--Placing Pieces-->
    <!--The site should know how many pieces each player has-->
    <!--User should be able to tap a menu and place the corresponding piece on the board in accordance with Catan's rules-->
    <!--Resources should be automatically deducted from a player's hand when they place a piece-->
    <!--This should all be visually represented on screen-->
    <!--Under the hood, values will need to be assigned to many different things-->
    <!--All data should be logged to user profile and player profiles-->

    <!--Playing Back Old Games-->
    <!--There should be an option to see a video of your old games-->

    <!--Statistical Analysis-->
    <!--Statistical data should be stored in databases and be abe to be indexed and searched-->
    <!--The ultimate goal would be being able to offer users a statistical analysis on the patterns and behaviours of certain players over time-->
    <!--All data should have the option to be manually changed-->
