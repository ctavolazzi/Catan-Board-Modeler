# Catan-Board-Modeler
An open-source project where users can manually generate a virtual Catan board used for creating and tracking statistical data of games played over time.
The project will do the following things (as I learn how to do them over time):
1) display a map of Catan, with images, in the user's browser window
2) users will manually enter tile and number data, starting clockwise from the sheep port
3) site will populate a GUI of the Catan board with tile and number images corresponding to user input
4) user then manually marks placement of settlements and roads
5) site will prompt confirmation, then will begin the game
6) user will manually select the number rolled from a popup GUI menu of all 12 possible numbers
7) site will automatically generate resources into users' hands according to their corresponding number values as assigned by the user
8) site will log all statistical data in an unknown number of databases
9) site will automatically deduct resources from users hands when
  a) resources are spent
  b) a player is robbed
    i) by the robber
    ii) by a player
10) future features to include:
  - leaderboards
  - photo scan to generate tile and number positions
  - customization options
  - more tbd.
